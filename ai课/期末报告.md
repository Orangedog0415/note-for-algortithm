## Research Problem and Objectives

### Research problems
Social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, have become significant sources of user-generated content where individuals express opinions and sentiments about various topics. However, analyzing sentiment across multimodal data—combining text, images, and videos—remains a challenging task. Traditional sentiment analysis methods primarily focus on text alone, ignoring the rich contextual information that visual and auditory signals can provide.

### Research objectives
The research aims to explore how Transformer-based models, such as BERT and GPT, can be extended to multimodal sentiment analysis, enabling the integration of text, images, and videos to provide a more accurate sentiment classification. The primary objectives of this research are:

*   To investigate how Transformer models can effectively combine multimodal data (text, image, and video) for sentiment analysis.
*   To compare the performance of Transformer-based multimodal models against traditional text-only sentiment analysis methods.
*   To develop an end-to-end framework for real-time sentiment analysis that can be deployed on social media platforms.

## Literature review

Sentiment analysis, particularly in the context of social media, has been extensively studied, with numerous developed models to classify sentiment in text data. Early models primarily relied on machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes, which achieved moderate success with structured text data (Pang et al., 2002). However, these models fall short when it comes to handling unstructured, noisy data from social media.

With the advent of deep learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were applied to text sentiment analysis, significantly improving performance (Kim, 2014; Cho et al., 2014). More recently, Transformer-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and GPT (Radford et al., 2018) have revolutionized the field of NLP, achieving state-of-the-art results on various sentiment analysis tasks. However, despite their success with textual data, these models are often limited to text alone and fail to incorporate multimodal inputs. Research on multimodal sentiment analysis is emerging, with studies attempting to combine text with images (Zhang et al., 2019) or videos (Li et al., 2020). These studies demonstrate that the fusion of modalities can improve sentiment classification, but challenges remain in effectively combining heterogeneous data types using a unified model.

## Research Methodology

The proposed research will use a Transformer-based architecture to integrate multimodal data (text, image, and video) for sentiment analysis. The approach will consist of three main phases:

### 1st Data Collection and Preprocessing: 

We will collect datasets from popular social media platforms, including text, image, and video data related to current events and trends. The data will be preprocessed for consistency, with text tokenized and images and videos preprocessed using standard computer vision techniques.

### 2nd Model Development: 

A multimodal Transformer-based model will be developed that utilizes separate encoders for text, images, and video inputs. Textual data will be processed using BERT, while images will be encoded with CNN-based feature extractors, and videos will be processed using 3D CNNs or temporal sequence models. The outputs of these encoders will be fused at multiple stages using attention mechanisms, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant features from each modality.

### 3rd Evaluation and Comparison: 

The performance of the proposed multimodal model will be evaluated against traditional text-based sentiment analysis methods on various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we will conduct an ablation study to assess the impact of each modality on overall performance.

## Expected Results and Significance

It is expected that the Transformer-based multimodal sentiment analysis model will outperform traditional text-only methods by leveraging the complementary information provided by images and videos. Specifically, we hypothesize that the fusion of text, image, and video features will lead to improved sentiment classification; particularly in cases where textual information alone is ambiguous.

The significance of this research lies in its potential to enhance sentiment analysis applications in social media monitoring, brand management, and political discourse. By developing a model that can analyze multimodal content in real-time, this research could help businesses and governments make more informed decisions based on public sentiment. Furthermore, this work contributes to the ongoing research on multimodal AI and provides a framework for integrating diverse data types in a unified model.
